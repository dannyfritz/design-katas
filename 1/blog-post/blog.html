One of the most exciting parts of starting a new blog is choosing the design elements that make your blog unique to you and your personality.</p>

        <p>But often times, it can be a little disorienting figuring out what looks best for your blog. You’ve seen websites that you think look attractive, but you’re not sure how to design your own.</p>

        <p>This guide is created to help you make aesthetic decisions about your blog including advice on how to choose the right theme for your blog and how to tweak it to meet your needs. You don’t need to know how to code to achieve a beautiful design. With all of the themes and plugins that Edublogs has to offer, you’re sure to find something that meets your needs.</p>

        <h3>What is the purpose of your blog?</h3>
        <p>It might seem a little strange to start with a philosophical question about the nature of your blog as opposed to diving into design elements head-first.</p>
        <p>But it’s important to think about the nature of what kinds of information you hope to share with your readers.</p>
        <p>Is this a class blog that is designed to showcase different projects that your students work on in class?</p>
        <p>Do you hope to gain a global reach and share insights with other teachers from around the world?</p>

        <p>Your purpose ultimately will dictate the design elements of your site, so it’s important to think about your audience as you go forth. What might seem cool to a class of third grade students might not look professional to an audience of teachers and administrators, so keep this at the forefront of your mind as we progress through the elements of design.</p>

        <h3>Choosing the best theme for your blog</h3>
        <p>A few years ago, it might have been the case that it was difficult to find the perfect theme for your blog. But with so many developers working on new themes over the past few years, the real challenge becomes sorting through all of the themes that are available to you.</p>

        <p>We’re fortunate here at Edublogs to have a wide selection of themes. At the time of writing this guide, we have 289 themes that you can choose from for your blog. Sue wrote an awesome post showcasing how easy it is to sort our themes by category.</p>

       <p> Though we have lots of beautiful themes to choose from, in each section I’ll highlight a few of my favorites.</p>

        <h3>Responsiveness</h3>
        <p>More and more school districts are implementing 1:1 device or BYOD policies, and several studies suggest that mobile (phones and tablets) makes up 27% of all web traffic.</p>
        <p>When I search for a new theme, I always start by searching for a theme that is responsive for mobile devices.</p>
        <p>It’s important that your audience has the same viewing experience on your blog, whether they are on a cell phone, tablet, or computer. By making it more accessible on every device, your users are much more likely to engage with your blog.</p>
        <p>Not all responsive themes are created equal. Some look great on a tablet, but not a phone, and it’s important that you have the ability to test out what your website looks like, even if you don’t own every device that your audience does.</p>
        <p>Thankfully, sites like <a href="http://mobile.me/">mobile.me</a> can help you visualize what your website will look like on different devices. Though I have an Android phone and an iMac, I don’t know what my website looks like on an tablet. This website shows me exactly how my blog looks to a visitor who is on an iPad.</p>

        <h4>Recommendations for responsive themes</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>Hum: A minimalist theme with a soft menu to emphasize your content.</li>
            <li>Responsive: As the name implies, this theme was designed for all of your devices. Want to see it in action? Our Edublogs Help site runs Responsive.</li>
           <li> Writr: A theme with a beautiful splash of color that highlights your author avatar.</li>
        </ul>
